<h1 style="text-align: center;">Printing Stuff to the Screen</h1>

<br />
<br />
<p>Let's introduce you to your first program.</p>

<hr />
<h3> first.c: </h3>
<pre>
  <code>
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
  }
  </code>
</pre>
<hr />
<br />

<p> 
There's a lot of jargon going on here. 
We'll introduce it one at a time.
All you need to know for now is that   
this program prints "Hello, World!" to   
the screen.
</p>   

<hr />
<div>
  <h3> Output: </h3>
  <pre>
  Hello, World!

  </pre>
</div>
<hr />
<br />

<p> 
The thing making this printing possible is "printf". 
printf is notable for multiple reasons. One of them
is the ability to print more than just text. It can
also print numbers, and other text. Let's change the code 
to demonstrate both abilities.
</p>

<hr />
<div>
  <h3> first.c: </h3>
  <pre>
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  int main() {
    printf("Hello, World! %d is a %s number.\n", 7, "lucky");
    return 0;
  }
  </pre>
</div>
<hr />
<br />

<hr />
<div>
  <h3> Output: </h3>
  <pre>
  Hello, World! 7 is a lucky number.

  </pre>
</div>
<hr />
<br />

<p> 
As shown, printf can take multiple things. The first thing
specifies how the output should look when given other data,
and the others specify what that data actually is.
We use "%d" and "%s" to print numbers and text respectively.
printf processes things sequentially left to right, so that 
the leftmost "%d" or "%s" gets the first piece of data, the 
second the second, etc.
</p>

<p>
There's more to printf, but this is sufficient to move on to
other parts, so that'll be all for this part. Next, we'll
go over variables and primitive data types to clarify what
I mean by "data" and "things" with a bit more rigor.
