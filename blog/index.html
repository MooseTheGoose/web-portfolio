  <h1>Crazy, Stupid Low-Level Adventures</h1>
  <hr />
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Youssef Moosa. I'm currently a CSE undergrad at OSU. <br />
    Welcome to my blog, where I explore all kinds of softwares and <br/>
    architectures and find out how they work.
  </p>
  <h2> Why am I making this blog? </h2>
  <p>
    CSE is stressful and I really need a hobby which is equally <br />
    relaxing and is more productive than playing video games and <br />
    watching anime. I figured that writing an HTML only blog about <br />
    what I've learned throughout my years would satisfy both, and <br />
    now I only need to put that to the test. <br/>
