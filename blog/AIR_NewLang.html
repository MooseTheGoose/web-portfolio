    <h1>AIR: A New Programming Language for Modern Machines</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is AIR?</h2>
    <p>
      ARM Intermediate Representation (AIR) is a new programming language <br />
      that I'm designing which is a C-like language that includes more <br />
      operations to better reflect the new capabilities of modern machines <br />
      and their instruction sets, as well as improve some of the things I <br />
      don't like about C.
    </p>
    <h2>Why AIR?</h2>
    <p>
      There are a lot of constructs in machine codes on a variety of machines <br />
      that translate very nicely to constructs in C. However, not every construct <br />
      translates so nicely. For instance, regular arithmetic operators (*, /, +, -), <br />
      are represented in C, but those same operators for GF(2) polynomials are not <br />
      represented so nicely. The only one represented is polynomial add/subtract (^) <br /> 
      even though polynomial arithmetic is used in a fair number of algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also features in C that are left out that would be a good <br />
      additions to C. For instance, treating arrays as structures which contain <br />
      pointer and length information, as well as supporting the conversion of pointers <br />
      to arrays is something that would be overall positive. A separate, dynamically created <br />
      type for multidimensional arrays could be done as well. Likewise, AIR can move on from <br />
      header files to a better package managing system. I haven't worked out the details of that <br />
      as much, yet.
    </p>
    <h2>What would AIR look like?</h2>
    <p>
      To start, here's what the "Hello, World" of AIR would look like
    </p>
    <pre>

i32 main(string[] argv) {
  printf("Hello, World\n")
  return 0
}
   </pre>
    <p>
      One thing to note is that, instead of main returning 'int', it returns 'i32' instead. <br />
      Integers are explicitly sized, except for 'int' and 'uint', which are the native int <br />
      and unsigned int types respectively (i.e., 32 bits on a 32-bit platform, 64 bits on a 64-bit platform). <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing to note is that argv is an array of strings instead of a pointer to pointer to char, which <br />
      would be the type of argv in C. This shows that AIR has a dedicated string type. There's also no argc. Where did it <br />
      go? The answer is that argc is argv.length. Arrays are structures with pointer and length that have some additional <br />
      syntax to go along with them. Nothing novel. Just things you see in more modern languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, statements can be, but don't have to be terminated with a semicolon. <br />
      They can also be terminated by a newline. There are exceptions to this, such as <br />
      newlines being ignored when inside parantheses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notation of pointers is different here than in C/C++. Here's an example.
    </p>
    <pre>

i32 main(string[] argv) {
  char! s := (char!)argv[0];
  printf("EXE name: %s\n", s)
  printf("First character: %c\n", [s])
  return 0
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      ! is no longer the logical not operator. It is the reference operator in AIR <br />
      (the address operator in C), and it is postfix instead of prefix. There are no <br />
      logical operators now. Instead, the logical or bitwise version is chosen depending <br />
      on the datatypes used (like it is in Visual Basic). Likewise, * is not the dereference <br />
      operator. Instead, the pointer is wrapped in [] to dereference it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of logical vs bitwise, below is an example of how that plays out.
    </p>
    <pre>

i32 main(string[] argv) {
  i32 x := 0
  i32 y := 1
  if ~(bool)x & (bool)y {
    printf("X is not true, Y is true\n")
    printf("3 ^ y: %d\n", 3 ^ y)
  } else if x = y {
    printf("Either X is true or Y is not true, and x = y\n")
  }
  return 0
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      So there's a separate bool type, and AIR is strongly typed, so <br />
      you must convert ints to bools to get the logical operator <br />
      instead of the bitwise operator. Conversion from int to bool <br />
      is nonzero true and zero false, just like in C/C++.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Now, let's have a bit of fun for this last code sample 
    </p>
    <pre>

i32 main() {
  veci32 acc := {1, 2, 3, 4}
  veci32 op := {5, 6, 7, 8}
  acc <<<= op
  acc *^= op
  acc *>>= op
  printf("acc = (%d, %d, %d, %d)\n", acc[0], acc[1], acc[2], acc[3])
  return 0
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      First, there are native 128-bit vectors, aligned on 16 byte boundaries. We define <br />
      some of those, then we perform a left rotate, a polynomial multiply, and a multiply <br />
      and store high part on the accumulator.
    </p> 
    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p> 
      I've been building up the language, but this is less novel than it sounds. <br />
      A lot of C compilers have intrinsics for more machine-specific things like <br />
      vectors, polynomial arithmetic, bit extractions, and the like, and the typing <br />
      system is only slightly less basic than C, with a lot of other languages beating it <br />
      in terms of nuance. Still, if I stopped doing things because other people have already <br />
      done them, I would never do anything. So, for now, and likely for the rest of the time I work <br />
      with AIR, "it's just a hobby, it won't be big or professional like C." <br />
      (Bonus points on CSE trivia to those of you who know what quote I just ripped off).
