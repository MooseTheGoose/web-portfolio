    <h1>AIR: A New Programming Language for Modern Machines</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Depreciated</h2>
    <p>
      I'm not going to work on this any time soon. There are a lot of other 
      things I want to do that would be both more rewarding and simpler. 
      Feel free to browse the ideas here, still.
    </p>
    <h2>What is AIR?</h2>
    <p>
      ARM Intermediate Representation (AIR) is a new programming language 
      that I'm designing which is a C-like language that includes more 
      operations to better reflect the new capabilities of modern machines 
      and their instruction sets, as well as improve some of the things I 
      don't like about C.
    </p>
    <h2>Why AIR?</h2>
    <p>
      There are a lot of constructs in machine codes on a variety of machines 
      that translate very nicely to constructs in C. However, not every construct 
      translates so nicely. For instance, regular arithmetic operators (*, /, +, -), 
      are represented in C, but those same operators for GF(2) polynomials are not 
      represented so nicely. The only one represented is polynomial add/subtract (^)  
      even though polynomial arithmetic is used in a fair number of algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also features in C that are left out that would be a good 
      additions to C. For instance, treating arrays as structures which contain 
      pointer and length information, as well as supporting the conversion of pointers 
      to arrays is something that would be overall positive. A separate, dynamically created 
      type for multidimensional arrays could be done as well. Likewise, AIR can move on from 
      header files to a better package managing system. I haven't worked out the details of that 
      as much, yet.
    </p>
    <h2>What would AIR look like?</h2>
    <p>
      To start, here's what the "Hello, World" of AIR would look like
    </p>
    <pre>

i32 main(string[] argv) {
  printf("Hello, World\n")
  return 0
}
   </pre>
    <p>
      One thing to note is that, instead of main returning 'int', it returns 'i32' instead. 
      Integers are explicitly sized, except for 'int' and 'uint', which are the native int 
      and unsigned int types respectively (i.e., 32 bits on a 32-bit platform, 64 bits on a 64-bit platform). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing to note is that argv is an array of strings instead of a pointer to pointer to char, which 
      would be the type of argv in C. This shows that AIR has a dedicated string type. There's also no argc. Where did it 
      go? The answer is that argc is argv.length. Arrays are structures with pointer and length that have some additional 
      syntax to go along with them. Nothing novel. Just things you see in more modern languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, statements can be, but don't have to be terminated with a semicolon. 
      They can also be terminated by a newline. There are exceptions to this, such as 
      newlines being ignored when inside parantheses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notation of pointers is different here than in C/C++. Here's an example.
    </p>
    <pre>

i32 main(string[] argv) {
  char! s := (char!)argv[0];
  printf("EXE name: %s\n", s)
  printf("First character: %c\n", [s])
  return 0
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      ! is no longer the logical not operator. It is the reference operator in AIR 
      (the address operator in C), and it is postfix instead of prefix. There are no 
      logical operators now. Instead, the logical or bitwise version is chosen depending 
      on the datatypes used (like it is in Visual Basic). Likewise, * is not the dereference 
      operator. Instead, the pointer is wrapped in [] to dereference it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of logical vs bitwise, below is an example of how that plays out.
    </p>
    <pre>

i32 main(string[] argv) {
  i32 x := 0
  i32 y := 1
  if ~(bool)x &amp; (bool)y {
    printf("X is not true, Y is true\n")
    printf("3 ^ y: %d\n", 3 ^ y)
  } else if x = y {
    printf("Either X is true or Y is not true, and x = y\n")
  }
  return 0
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      So there's a separate bool type, and AIR is strongly typed, so 
      you must convert ints to bools to get the logical operator 
      instead of the bitwise operator. Conversion from int to bool 
      is nonzero true and zero false, just like in C/C++.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Now, let's have a bit of fun for this last code sample 
    </p>
    <pre>

i32 main() {
  veci32 acc := {1, 2, 3, 4}
  veci32 op := {5, 6, 7, 8}
  acc &lt;&lt;&lt;= op
  acc *^= op
  acc *&gt;&gt;= op
  printf("acc = (%d, %d, %d, %d)\n", acc[0], acc[1], acc[2], acc[3])
  return 0
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      First, there are native 128-bit vectors, aligned on 16 byte boundaries. We define 
      some of those, then we perform a left rotate, a polynomial multiply, and a multiply 
      and store high part on the accumulator.
    </p> 
    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p> 
      I've been building up the language, but this is less novel than it sounds. 
      A lot of C compilers have intrinsics for more machine-specific things like 
      vectors, polynomial arithmetic, bit extractions, and the like, and the typing 
      system is only slightly less basic than C, with a lot of other languages beating it 
      in terms of nuance. Still, if I stopped doing things because other people have already 
      done them, I would never do anything. So, for now, and likely for the rest of the time I work 
      with AIR, "it's just a hobby, it won't be big or professional like C." 
      (Bonus points on CSE trivia to those of you who know what quote I just ripped off).
