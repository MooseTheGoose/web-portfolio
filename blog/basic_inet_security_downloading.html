    <h1>Basic Internet Security Part 1: Downloading Things</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This is going to be less technical than my other posts. It's more about how the average user of
      computers can safely browse the internet through browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and the like.
      Note that I say parts, but the parts aren't really related. You can read them in any order.
    </p>
    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <p>
      We'll assume the following points
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Web Browsers can be trusted</li>
      <li>
        You can take the following for granted if and only if the browser says your connection is secure
        <ul>
          <li>The site is who they say they are</li>
          <li>Data transmitted is encrypted so that sensitive information can be exchanged</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I may refer to these assumptions as assumption 1, 2 respectively in this post.
    </p>
    <p>
      These assumptions are mostly true in the real world. People use Chrome and Firefox 
      everyday, and people would notice if these browsers became suddenly malicious and would 
      hold those responsible very accountable for assumption 1. Your browser uses HTTPS for 
      assumption 2. You can read more about HTTPS elsewhere if you're curious. While these 
      assumptions aren't guaranteed to be true, they're good enough for this post to still 
      be practical in the real world.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems with Downloading Things from the Internet</h2>
    <p>
      If your browser says your connection is secure, then so long as you trust the site,  
      you can just download the program without considering it due to assumption 1. However, 
      downloading the program from just that site has the big disadvantage that it biases 
      download speeds and costs based on how close you are to the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fix this, there exists servers called mirrors which store some content downloadable
      from the original server, but are hosted in a different location to improve download
      speeds in that area. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To give an example, say the episodes to my favorite anime are officially 
      stored as video files in a server in Japan. Video files are really big, and it sucks
      that I have to download and/or stream those files from such a lousy connection. Therefore,
      I'll opt to choose a mirror in the US (Ideally, in Ohio). If one doesn't exist, I might do
      my community a favor by hosting a mirror for others to download from.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one should already see a really, really, big problem with this.
      Mirror sites are inherently untrustworthy. Even if the browser says its secure,
      they're often not credible enough inherently to trust them. Furthermore, a lot of
      sites will opt out of HTTPS and will use just HTTP to reduce costs, maintenance,
      and expertise needed, especially in developing countries, which means data isn't
      encrypted and you can't verify if the site is actually who they say they are. The former
      isn't bothersome, since it's usually very predictable what you're downloading from
      the mirror anyways. The latter is the real problem, even for mirrors which
      are well-established.
    </p>
    <h2>Solution: Hashing</h2>
    <p>
      People have thought up of solutions to how to retain security while
      still keeping mirrors around. What they usually entail is having
      a small signature of the trusted file with some way to verify it hasn't
      been tampered with, and comparing the generated signature of the 
      downloaded file to the signature on the secure site. If the signatures
      match, then the file has not been tampered with. Otherwise, it has.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you think about this method a little, this isn't perfect.
      There are only so many signatures you can assign before some
      duplicate signatures pop up. However, these signatures are generated
      so that it's computationally infeasible to find a file which
      generates the signature of another, given there isn't a file
      in some sort of database that luckily matches its signature. It's
      even harder to actually make a file which is malicious that matches
      the signature, so this is a really good method given a really good
      algorithm for generating a signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is this signature? Most sites will use what's called a cryptographic
      hashing algorithm. "Hashing" is a way to turn an arbitrarily sized message into
      a number, and for 2 equal messages to turn into 2 equal numbers. "Cryptographic" 
      means the hashing algorithm has the following properties given that an attacker
      has no database.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Given only the hash, it's computationally infeasible to find any message with the same hash</li>
      <li>Given the message and its hash, It's computationally infeasible to find a different message with the same hash</li>
      <li>It's computationally infeasible to find 2 different messages with the same hash</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Given these properties, it's perfect to use to generate a file signature, 
      as the signature can't be easily imitated while tampering a file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most commonly used hashing algorithms for this are SHA256, SHA512.
      If a site still uses MD5 or SHA1 as a hashing algorithm, you shouldn't
      trust it anymore. These hash algorithms used to be good, but as computers
      got more powerful, it became feasible to generate malicious messages with the same hash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, enough of the theory. Let's apply this with an example.
      Suppose I download a free video from my favorite anime and I'm
      given the following SHA256 hash from a website I trust.

      <br /><br />
      43E1CA90118C443731891D09D446F68CCDBCBD880754169FFBB078DE0FBEC216
      <br /><br />

      I download the video from http://oh.the-best-anime-mirror.org/
      on a Windows machine and it's in my downloads folder. Then
      I can open up Powershell, and go into my downloads folder.
      The bottom line will look like this
    </p>
    <pre>PS C:\Users\Moose\Downloads&gt;</pre>
    <p>
      After I type 'Get-FileHash -Algorithm "SHA256" favorite_anime_S1_E7.mp4' and press enter, 
      the output will look like this. 
    </p>
    <pre>PS C:\Users\Moose\Downloads&gt; Get-FileHash -Algorithm "SHA256" favorite_anime_S1_E7.mp4
    Algorithm           Hash                                                                Path
    ----------         --------                                                            -------
    SHA256             43E1CA90118C443731891D09D446F68CCDBCBD880754169FFBB078DE0FBEC216    C:\Users\Moose\Downloads\favo...
    </pre>
    <p>
      Because the hash output matches letter by letter to the hash I was given,
      I can reasonably doubt that the file has been tampered with and watch
      the episode I've been waiting to watch for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't a great tutorial on how to do this. I suggest you look up how to use
      Powershell, and look up "Get-FileHash" once you're comfortable with Powershell.
      Learning Powershell for just that is worth it.
    </p>
    <h2>How can I trust the hash?</h2>
    <p>
      First, if your browser says the site is secure, and you trust the site,
      then you trust the hash. Otherwise, you're out of luck unless the site
      you're downloading from has an alternate way to verify. One especially
      popular way to do so is OpenPGP, and an especially popular implementation
      is GnuPG. This allows even the untrusted mirror to keep the hash so long
      as they keep the signature generated by GnuPG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly, this option is more difficult for downloaders to go through,
      but you'll usually have instructions to go along with the download
      for how to use gpg, since the hosts to the website will acknowledge
      this difficulty and also because specific, widely trusted servers
      are used which the client needs to be aware of.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      We discussed how to download programs in a secure fashion while still
      keeping the option to download from a mirror. There are steps that are
      involved that are more advanced than the average computer user normally
      deals with, but not dauntingly so. Even when it is, hosts of the downloads
      are usually very accomodating to the end user and provide enough help
      to deal with the extra complexity.
