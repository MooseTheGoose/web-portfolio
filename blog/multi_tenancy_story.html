    <h1>A Story Illustrating Multi-Tenacy</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>A Word of Warning</h2>
    <p>
      This story does not get to the point. This
      is a fun, fantastical piece which I aim
      to make entertaining more than informative,
      though I hope this one way of illustrating
      multi-tenancy is insightful.

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, there was a fair and kind
      lady named Alice. She was born in the kingdom of
      Disperus. It was a great kingdom with amazing
      agriculture and mechanical industry, but it didn't
      value technology as much, especially the internet.
      There was still a lot of controversy about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice's family were people who were okay with it, 
      so they had a computer and a router in their house.
      They didn't let Alice touch the computer until she
      was old enough. When she was 16, they saw how amazing
      and wonderful of a lady she turned out to be and decided
      to trust her with computer and internet access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice absolutely loved the computer and the internet.
      She ended up spending much of her free time learning
      about software, ranging from operating systems to
      web services. She would go on internet forums under
      the user name of xXKingzOfSpadezXx and actively engage
      in conversations online. She especially adored the land
      of Crofox, which was responsible for much of the internet
      and computer manufacturing.
