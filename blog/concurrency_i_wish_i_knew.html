    <h1>Things about Concurrency I Wish I was Tuaght in OS Class</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      There's a lot of things System II (OS class) at OSU taught me, and I'm <br />
      very thankful for everything I learned from there. However, there are <br />
      also details that weren't taught that definitely apply to modern <br />
      operating systems that really should have been taught. These details <br />
      can mostly be found by digging through Intel's Software Developer Manual <br />
      and the ARMv8 Technical Reference Manual or just talking to someone about <br />
      it and are quick, short topics to discuss, so there's not much reason this <br />
      (and what I'm sure are many other details) should be left out. Without <br />
      further ado, let's get right to it.
