    <h1>Things about Concurrency I Wish I was Taught in OS Class</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2> My Beef with Systems II </h2>
    <p>
      There's a lot of things System II (OS class) at OSU taught me, and I'm 
      very thankful for everything I learned from there. However, there are 
      also details that weren't taught that definitely apply to modern 
      operating systems that really should have been taught. These details 
      can mostly be found by digging through Intel's Software Developer Manual 
      and the ARMv8 Technical Reference Manual or just talking to someone about 
      it and are quick, short topics to discuss, so there's not much reason this 
      (and what I'm sure are many other details) should be left out. Without 
      further ado, let's get right to it.
    </p>
    <h2> 1. Machine Instructions needn't be Atomic </h2>
    <p>
     Generally, I was taught that interrupts happen at the computer, and they 
     can happen at any instruction, which is why we have to have data structures 
     like semaphores, mutexes, etc. However, I did not know that interrupts can 
     actually happen in the middle of an instruction such that some of the side 
     effects of an instruction happen and others don't. An example is STMIA from 
     the ARM instruction set. This stores multiple registers into memory. However, 
     the instruction is allowed to be interrupted such that some registers get stored 
     and others don't at the time of an interrupt. For most software, this doesn't 
     matter. This matters to Operating Systems because writing to certain pieces of 
     memory has such dramatic side effects that writing somewhere twice when it 
     should've only been once is fatal (i.e. memory-mapped IO).
    </p>
    <h2> 2. My Program Loads and Stores Things in Order, Right? </h2>
    <p>
      Wrong. Modern computers are not only free to execute multiple instructions 
      at once and out of order (which I was taught), but are also free to let 
      their side effects take place out of order (which I was not taught). 
      That means if you ran the below code.
    </p>
<pre>
MOV DWORD PTR [RAX], 24      ; Store new data
MOV DWORD PTR [RAX + 4], 0   ; Release lock
</pre>
    <p>
      The machine is free to store 0 at [RAX + 4] before storing 24 at [RAX]. 
      This is, of course, very alarming for structures like semaphores and  
      mutexes, as this means that the critical section hasn't completed even 
      after correct usage of these structures. How architectures deal with this 
      is that they have special instructions to explicitly make it so that all 
      memory accesses before those instructions happen before memory accesses 
      after those instructions. For Intel, it's MFENCE, and for ARM, that's DMB. 
      There are more of these synchronization instructions, but let's keep it 
      simple for now and leave it at that.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Everything Needs to be Locked with Semaphores</h2>
    <p>
      Oh, heavens, no! There are actually a lot of operations that can be done 
      atomically with the right instructions on the right machines. Not only that, 
      but your OS and/or compiler will have special functions or intrinsics so that 
      you can access these in a machine-independent way. These operations include 
      all the normal operations (bitwise, arithmetic) as well as others like atomic 
      exchange. There will also be functions and intrinsics for memory barriers 
      mentioned above. These make creating "lockless" code less ad hoc and 
      often ends up being more performant than code with locking. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of keeping with the theme of using assembly, let's see some 
      specific assembly examples of these atomic instructions. Let's say that 
      I want to do something straightforward like increment a 64-bit value in memory. 
      To do this atomically in x86_64, we write
    </p>
<pre>
LOCK INC QWORD PTR [RAX]
</pre>
    <p>
      What the "lock prefix" does is make sure that an instruction which would normally 
      not be atomic is atomic. The lock prefix can be applied to a variety of instructions. 
      For the sake of brevity, we'll leave it at that.
    </p>
    <h2> End </h2>
    <p>
      There's definitely more I haven't gotten to, but this is good material for 
      a concise blog post about some of the problems in concurrency that come up 
      which are, unfortunately, missed in my OS class.
