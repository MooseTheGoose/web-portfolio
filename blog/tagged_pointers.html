    <h1>Tag, You're It: Introduction to Tagged Pointers</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>What are Tagged Pointers?</h2>
    <p>
      If you've taken a class that's similar to Systems I that went over low-level 
      computer organization, you'll know that certain data types are aligned  
      differently. For instance, on x86, words are aligned on a 2-byte boundary, 
      dwords on a 4-byte boundary, and qwords on an 8-byte boundary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because virtual addresses to certain data needs to be aligned, the lower bits 
      of addresses are unused, and "tags" can be stored there, which are bits 
      associated with the address. For instance, in a garbage collector, a tag 
      can be stored to mark a reference as strong or weak. This has the advantage 
      of both saving memory and making atomic access to these members along with 
      the address easier and more performant. Addresses which pack these tag bits 
      inside themselves are called tagged pointers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is an example of how to store and extract tags with x86 assembly 
      language which goes off of the previous garbage collector example.
    </p>
    <pre>
MOV EAX, addr_of_new_object  ; Get address of allocated memory
OR EAX, 1                    ; Mark object as weak 
MOV [ESP + obj_offset], EAX  ; Store object in stack</pre>
    <h2>Tagged pointers in C/C++</h2>
    <p>
      Pointers in C/C++ represent addresses and, while you can't do things like 
      bitwise ops with them portably, among other things, (though most compilers will  
      let you get away with it) you can convert them to integers which let you do 
      those operations. In fact, there's even a data type defined in stdint.h called 
      (u)intptr_t for the purpose of converting pointers to integers and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the conversion from pointer to integer and vice versa is actually 
      implementation-defined. However, for a paging memory model, that 
      conversion normally stores the virtual address in the integer. 
      Interestingly, x86 has a segmented memory model along with paging, 
      and the conversion process for that simply ignores the segment number.  
      This is a behavior that many programs rely on currently, and is unlikely 
      to change in the future. Below is an example of how this conversion looks. 
    </p>
    <pre>
void * ptr;
uintptr_t rawaddress;
rawaddress = (uintptr_t)ptr;
ptr = (void *)rawaddress;</pre>
  <h2>How do I do it?</h2>
  <p>
    To give a basic example, consider a straightforward structure of a  
    red-black tree in a language without tagged pointers, like Java. 
    Here's what it would look like. 
  </p>
  <pre>
public class RBTree&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
  T data;
  boolean red;
  RBTree&lt;T&gt; left, right;
}</pre>
  <p>
    This is how a the tagged version would look like in C.
  </p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

// Data for red-black tree
struct RBTreeData;

// Indexes for children
#define RBTREE_LEFT 0
#define RBTREE_RIGHT 1

// Tag and macros to extract pointer and tag respectively
#define RBTREE_RED_TAG 1
#define RBTREE_NODE(uptr) (struct RBTree *)((uptr) &amp; ~RBTREE_RED_TAG)
#defome RBTREE_RED(uptr) ((uptr) &amp; RBTREE_RED_TAG)
struct RBTree {
  struct RBTreeData data;
  uintptr_t children[2];
};

// Behaves similarly to strcmp()
int compareData(struct RBTreeData * lhs, struct RBTree * rhs);

// Example usage:
//
// tree = RBTREE_NODE(tagged);
// color = RBTREE_RED(tagged);</pre>
  <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
  <p>
    As mentioned before, tags can save some space. Some bytes 
    here and there might not seem a lot, but this extra space 
    can make you evict more cache lines than you asked for, 
    especially for data structures which have poor locality 
    of reference, like trees. Even then, where tags really 
    shine is their ability to very closely associate pointers 
    with very important information associated with them. 
    Accessing multiple pieces of data compactly and atomically 
    like this is like a magic trick that comes up strangely often, 
    and it remains cool every time. Tags can even be used to help 
    memory safety in languages like C. ARM uses the Memory Tagging 
    Extensions to mark pointers to identify whether a pointer points  
    to the heap, stack, etc., to give an example.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for cons, most modern languages actually have no such 
    capability, for one, so you can't even apply this same 
    trick in applications in those languages. Honestly, this 
    is very understandable, since implementers of these languages 
    often need tags to implement the runtime, or just can't trust 
    you with tags to retain the memory safety these languages claim. 
    Speaking of which, memory safety. Tagged pointers can both help 
    and hurt the memory safety of your program. Be careful with them.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Tagged pointers are really cool, and I recommend you play around 
    with them a bit on your own time to get a feel for them and how 
    they can be useful. That being said, make sure you understand 
    alignment so that you understand when it works and when it doesn't.
