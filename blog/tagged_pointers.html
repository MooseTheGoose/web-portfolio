    <h1>Tag, You're It: Introduction to Tagged Pointers</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>What are Tagged Pointers?</h2>
    <p>
      If you've taken a class that's similar to Systems I that went over low-level <br />
      computer organization, you'll know that certain data types are aligned  <br />
      differently. For instance, on x86, words are aligned on a 2-byte boundary, <br />
      dwords on a 4-byte boundary, and qwords on an 8-byte boundary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because virtual addresses to certain data needs to be aligned, the lower bits <br />
      of addresses are unused, and "tags" can be stored there, which are bits <br />
      associated with the address. For instance, in a garbage collector, a tag <br />
      can be stored to mark a reference as strong or weak. This has the advantage <br />
      of both saving memory and making atomic access to these members along with <br />
      the address easier and more performant. Addresses which pack these tag bits <br />
      inside themselves are called tagged pointers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is an example of how to store and extract tags with x86 assembly <br />
      language which goes off of the previous garbage collector example.
    </p>
    <pre>
MOV EAX, addr_of_new_object  ; Get address of allocated memory
OR EAX, 1                    ; Mark object as weak 
MOV [ESP + obj_offset], EAX  ; Store object in stack</pre>
    <h2>Tagged pointers in C/C++</h2>
    <p>
      Pointers in C/C++ represent addresses and, while you can't do things like <br />
      bitwise ops with them portably, among other things, (though most compilers will  <br />
      let you get away with it) you can convert them to integers which let you do <br />
      those operations. In fact, there's even a data type defined in stdint.h called <br />
      (u)intptr_t for the purpose of converting pointers to integers and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the conversion from pointer to integer and vice versa is actually <br />
      implementation-defined. However, for a paging memory model, that <br />
      conversion normally stores the virtual address in the integer. <br />
      Interestingly, x86 has a segmented memory model along with paging, <br />
      and the conversion process for that simply ignores the segment number.  <br />
      This is a behavior that many programs rely on currently, and is unlikely <br />
      to change in the future. Below is an example of how this conversion looks. <br />
    </p>
    <pre>
void * ptr;
uintptr_t rawaddress;
rawaddress = (uintptr_t)ptr;
ptr = (void *)rawaddress;</pre>
  <h2>How do I do it?</h2>
  <p>
    To give a basic example, consider a straightforward structure of a  <br />
    red-black tree in a language without tagged pointers, like Java. <br />
    Here's what it would look like. <br />
  </p>
  <pre>
public class RBTree&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
  T data;
  boolean red;
  RBTree&lt;T&gt; left, right;
}</pre>
  <p>
    This is how a the tagged version would look like in C.
  </p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

// Data for red-black tree
struct RBTreeData;

// Indexes for children
#define RBTREE_LEFT 0
#define RBTREE_RIGHT 1

// Tag and macros to extract pointer and tag respectively
#define RBTREE_RED_TAG 1
#define RBTREE_NODE(uptr) (struct RBTree *)((uptr) &amp; ~RBTREE_RED_TAG)
#defome RBTREE_RED(uptr) ((uptr) &amp; RBTREE_RED_TAG)
struct RBTree {
  struct RBTreeData data;
  uintptr_t children[2];
};

// Behaves similarly to strcmp()
int compareData(struct RBTreeData * lhs, struct RBTree * rhs);

// Example usage:
//
// tree = RBTREE_NODE(tagged);
// color = RBTREE_RED(tagged);</pre>
  <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
  <p>
    As mentioned before, tags can save some space. Some bytes <br />
    here and there might not seem a lot, but this extra space <br />
    can make you evict more cache lines than you asked for, <br />
    especially for data structures which have poor locality <br />
    of reference, like trees. Even then, where tags really <br />
    shine is their ability to very closely associate pointers <br />
    with very important information associated with them. <br />
    Accessing multiple pieces of data compactly and atomically <br />
    like this is like a magic trick that comes up strangely often, <br />
    and it remains cool every time. Tags can even be used to help <br />
    memory safety in languages like C. ARM uses the Memory Tagging <br />
    Extensions to mark pointers to identify whether a pointer points <br /> 
    to the heap, stack, etc., to give an example.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for cons, most modern languages actually have no such <br />
    capability, for one, so you can't even apply this same <br />
    trick in applications in those languages. Honestly, this <br />
    is very understandable, since implementers of these languages <br />
    often need tags to implement the runtime, or just can't trust <br />
    you with tags to retain the memory safety these languages claim. <br />
    Speaking of which, memory safety. Tagged pointers can both help <br />
    and hurt the memory safety of your program. Be careful with them.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Tagged pointers are really cool, and I recommend you play around <br />
    with them a bit on your own time to get a feel for them and how <br />
    they can be useful. That being said, make sure you understand <br />
    alignment so that you understand when it works and when it doesn't.
