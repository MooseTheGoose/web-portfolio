  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p>    
    I am a CSE student at OSU interested in operating systems and programming languages. <br />
    I really enjoy assembly programming in all sorts of architectures. <br />
    This includes ARM, x86_64, and 
    <a href="https://www.pastraiser.com/cpu/gameboy/gameboy_opcodes.html">
      "GBZ80"
    </a>
  </p>
    My hobbies include playing video games, listening to music, <br />
    and watching TV, all of which are, of course, standard hobbies.
  </p>
  <p>
   I also have some less standard hobbies, like playing Chess <br />
   and participating in Cybersecurity CTFs.
