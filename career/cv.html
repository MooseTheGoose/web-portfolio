    <p>Dear [To Whom this Concerns]</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm really interested in the [Position] position at [Company Name] 
      and I'm confident my experiences with cybersecurity, computer
      systems, and web development would make me a strong addition to the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      My involvement with the cybersecurity club at OSU has taught me a lot
      of valuable lessons and tricks which help me to recognize vulnerabilities
      and patterns that lead to them. I also have a lot of practical experiences
      from the CTFs I participate in with the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also really like to study a variety of computer systems and how they work.
      Along with studying Linux exploits, which is fairly standard at the cybersecurity
      club, I also study Windows exploits and how they correlate with their Linux counterparts.
      Likewise, I also study less usual systems. In particular, I like to study older
      gaming consoles, and have some practical experience with dealing with the Gameboy
      and the Gameboy Advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working remotely at Nagwa, with most of my work going towards building
      Python scripts to automate tasks on the web development side, and some of my
      work involving actual web development, I gained a lot of knowledge about web 
      development and Python that I use today to exploit Python and the web. In particular,
      I did a lot of work with files and web APIs which gave me insights on good and bad
      ways deal with the two. Doing it in Python also helped me to realize its power, which
      helps me in exploits regarding the langauge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd be a real pleasure to put the skills mentioned above to use in your team at [Company Name],
      which I'm confident would be valuable for the [Position] position in [Company Name]. I look forward
      to hearing back from you about the position. Thank you for your considerations.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
     Sincerely, <br />
     Youssef Moosa
